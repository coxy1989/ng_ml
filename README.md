This repository contains my solutions to the octave assignments I completed whilst following Andrew Ng's popular [*Machine Learning* coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

*All the material for Andrew Ng's course is available for free but you have to pay $70 If you want a certificate, so I gave that a miss. The solutions in this repo obtain full credit in all the assignments.*
